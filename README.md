# treetree


We're going to plant 60 mln trees around the globe annually till 2111. It gives a chance for Earth to save biological life entire 2150 for sure.


### The Reason

- 600 mlrd - average quantity of trees by today. It's decreasing by nature, so in 2150 just 300 mlrd of them will appear
- 10 mlrd of people needs oxygen from around 400 mlrd trees
- and also 400 mln trees cutted down every year today, so if we didn't stopped it - whole planet will have no food.


### Why Blockchain?

- we're processing colossal and scattered ammount of super-controversial data
- we're disturbing our impact to the future, so we need valuable finance tool for next hundred years
- it's only way to have totally secured contributions from any city
